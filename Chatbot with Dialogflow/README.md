# Building Chatbots from Existing Content using Google Dialogflow
Building #chatbots is no fun if you have to manually specify every intent, action, or response.

I was searching for a #chatbot building tool that could #automatically #generate intent and responses from my existing content. Then I found Google Dialogflowâ€™s Knowledge feature.

Though it is still in beta (since 2019) and not yet perfect, this feature does a good-enough job of generating FAQ-style knowledge base off existing web content for chatbots.

Here is a short clip, in which I create a knowledge base and a chatbot for travel insurance policy and test them in under 3 minutes.
