# About the UX Design Assignment
For my UX Design assignment, I created the mockups for a fictitious application Planr, which allows to manage a user's daily/weekly/monthly schedule across various work, personal, social accounts.
This application synchronizes the calendars, to-dos, and reminders across these accounts and enables the user to manage them in one place. It also enables the users to automate some actions, such as:
 - sending emails or social media updates
 - setting up auto-responses
 - scheduling work meetings
 - setting up quiet time

I created mockups for the smartwatch, laptop, and wall/smartTV interfaces of this applications. Each interface is designed for the specific device and yet maintains look-and-feel uniformity across the interfaces.
